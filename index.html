  <div class="sub-heading">Water Cycle</div>
  <div class="point">Describes the natural cycle of water changing from liquid to vapor through evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Continual Transformation</div>
  <div class="point">Highlights the enduring presence of water as it cycles between oceans, atmosphere, and land over centuries.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Sources of Freshwater</div>
  <div class "point">Major sources of freshwater include rivers, ponds, springs, and glaciers, while oceans primarily contain salty water.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Salty Oceans</div>
  <div class="point">Oceans contain salty water due to a high concentration of dissolved salts, mainly sodium chloride (table salt).</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Global Water Circulation</div>
  <div class="point">Emphasizes how water used in one location today can travel through various water bodies in the past, showcasing Earth's interconnected water systems.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Ocean Dynamics</div>
  <div class="point">Describes the continuous movement of ocean water in contrast to still ponds and lakes.</div>

  <!-- Repeat the same structure for other sections -->
  
  <div class="sub-heading">Types of Movements</div>
  <div class="point">Identifies ocean movements such as waves, tides, and currents, illustrating the dynamic nature of ocean circulation.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Seashore Experience</div>
  <div class="point">Portrays the sensory delights of the ocean environment, like wet sand, seabirds, and the rhythmic sound of waves.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Wave Characteristics</div>
  <div class="point">Describes waves as the alternating rise and fall of ocean water, often seen at the beach.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Beach Interaction</div>
  <div class="point">Highlights how waves playfully interact at the beach, washing objects like a ball back to the shore.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Storms Create Huge Waves</div>
  <div class="point">Winds during storms generate massive waves with destructive potential.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Tsunamis from Geological Events</div>
  <div class="point">Geological events like earthquakes trigger tsunamis, immensely destructive tidal waves.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Historic Tsunami</div>
  <div class="point">Describes the 2004 tsunami, a tragic event showcasing the power of tsunamis.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Tsunami Height</div>
  <div class="point">Mentions tsunamis can reach heights up to 150m, indicating their potential for devastation.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Tidal Mechanism</div>
  <div class="point">Tides are rhythmic ocean movements influenced by the sun and moon's gravitational forces.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Tide Types</div>
  <div class="point">High tides flood shores, low tides expose more beach area.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Tide Variation</div>
  <div class="point">Spring tides (full or new moons) create the highest tides, neap tides (moon's quarters) produce lower tides.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Practical Benefits</div>
  <div class="point">High tides aid navigation and fishing, while tidal energy is harnessed for electricity.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Definition of Ocean Currents</div>
  <div class="point">Ocean currents are continuous streams of water following specific paths on the ocean's surface.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Types of Currents</div>
  <div class="point">Warm currents originate near the equator, while cold currents come from polar regions.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Influence on Temperature</div>
  <div class="point">Warm ocean currents affect nearby land temperatures and climate.</div>

  <div class="sub-heading">Fishing and Climate Impact</div>
  <div class="point">Convergence of warm and cold currents creates prime fishing areas but can lead to foggy weather affecting navigation.</div>
